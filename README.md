# Estimation-of-Electricity-Production-from-Photovoltaic-Panels
This repository contains the code snippets associated with the project "Estimation of Electricity Production from Photovoltaic Panels" under the supervision of Prof. Yann Busnel (IMT Atlantique) , Prof. Nicolas Montavont (IMT Atlantique) and Prof. Kapil Ahuja (IIT Indore)

The data for the above research can be downloaded from http://photovolta2.univ-nantes.fr/
The data files need to be downloaded individually for every feature. They can be processed and combined using the processing.py python script.

The Pivotal_sampling.py file contains an implementation of pivotal sampling which changes the inclusion probabilities based on the charge of the device and the importance of the reading. 

In case of any query in reference to the above code, kindly contact me at ee1600002059(at)iiti(dot)ac(dot)in
